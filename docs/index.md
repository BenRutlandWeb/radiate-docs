# Getting started

Radiate is a WordPress theme and plugin framework designed for super fast project scaffolding so you can get up and running as soon as possible.

Heavily inspired by Laravel, Radiate is a lightweight framework with fluent APIs for working with core WordPress features such as the REST API, `WP_CLI`, shortcodes, `wp_mail`, `add_action()` and more.
